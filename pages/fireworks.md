Skagit County regulates fireworks within the unincorporated portions of the county, i.e., outside the boundaries of the cities and towns. The Washington State Patrol maintains [a list of local fireworks bans or restricted sales and use](http://wsp.wa.gov/fireworks).

## Legal and Illegal Fireworks
In unincorporated Skagit County, only [fireworks allowed by state law](http://wsp.wa.gov/fireworks) are allowed. [Fireworks are illegal on state forestlands](http://file.dnr.wa.gov/publications/rp_fireprev_firework.pdf) and in most parks.

**Sky lanterns are prohibited** in unincorporated Skagit County by SCC 15.04.030. “Sky Lantern” means any sky candles, fire balloons and other airborne lanterns made of paper or other combustible material with a wood frame containing a candle, fuel cell composed of waxy flammable material or other open flame which serves as a heat source to heat the air inside the device to cause it to lift into the air.

## Sale of Fireworks
Fireworks may only be sold during the [dates and times set by the State Fire Protection Bureau](http://wsp.wa.gov/fireworks). The Sheriff may seize fireworks offered or exposed for sale in violation of this chapter, and a violation is a misdemeanor. More [rules on fireworks stands](http://wsp.wa.gov/fireworks) are available from the State Fire Marshal.

## General Safety Tips

* Never allow children to play with or ignite fireworks.
* Read and follow all warnings and instructions.
* Be sure other people are out of range before lighting fireworks.
* Only light fireworks on a smooth, flat surface away from the house, dry leaves, and flammable materials.
* Never try to relight fireworks that have not fully functioned.
* Keep a bucket of water in case of a malfunction or fire.
* Fireworks should be used only with extreme caution.
* Older children should be closely supervised, and younger children should not be allowed to play with fireworks. 

## Proper steps to dispose of your used fireworks safely and effectively.
* Allow fireworks one hour of cooling-off time before handling.
* Fill an appropriately sized five(5) gallon bucket or trash can halfway up with water.
* After one hour, place all used fireworks, including duds and sparklers into the trash can.
* Let the fireworks soak overnight in the water-filled bin away from any structures.
* Wrap or double wrap the fireworks in a water-soaked plastic bag so they can’t dry out and transfer them to your regular garbage bin for pickup or take them to your local solid waste facility.
