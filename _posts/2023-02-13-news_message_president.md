**When my wife and I were first introduced to the Lake Cavanaugh community in the mid-1980’s, we certainly had no idea we would ever own property on the lake. Yet, here we are in the early part of 2023 and we feel blessed to have been on the lake for nearly thirty years.**

Like so many of us, my wife, Tammy, and I first discovered this wonderful lake through our friends. Our weekend adventures up here with them eventually inspired us to seek out a place of our own. We worked with Dottie and Warren Otteson to take ownership of a rustic little cabin, with no electrical service and no running water. We have “fond” memories of our first nights in that cabin, sharing the space with the resident mice who had apparently assumed ownership prior to our arrival. As with o many families on the lake, the sale of that first cabin enabled us to purchase our next cabin, which was built in the 1950’s. We have now been happily ensconced just off of West Shore since 1999 with no intentions of moving elsewhere.

As all who own property on the lake can attest, Lake Cavanaugh becomes a part of who we are and where we belong. Ours is a unique and amazing community. It is certainly defined, in part, by the physical beauty: the mountains, the clear water, the wildlife and amazing seasonal changes. As important as these characteristics are, it is the inherent bond we share as residents of the lake which brings us together. While we may not know all who cruise by our docks throughout the year, we still feel a connection which is rooted in our common understanding of just how special our lake is.

This was in the forefront of my mind when Shannon O’Kelly recently asked me to take on this position. Many of the friends we have made at the lake are now considered family. In listening to them and observing their commitment to our community, I saw the importance of becoming more involved at the lake. I am looking forward to working with the other committed board members of the LCIA, as well as all of our LCIA members, to maintain Lake Cavanaugh as the special place we know it to be.

See you on the lake!
