Dear Lake Cavanaugh Neighbors,


In the summer of 2019, I learned of Forest
Practices Application (FPA) 2817112 from Cathy Katte
who was then the President of the Lake Cavanaugh
Trust. FPA 2817112 was approved on August 29,
2019, by the Washington State Department of Natural
Resources (DNR). This approval allowed the timber
harvest on a portion of approximately 270 acres of
forest lands on Frailey Mountain abutting the Plat
of Lake Cavanaugh Subdivision No. 3. Access to
the timber harvest areas on Frailey Mountain was
shown on the FPA through a residential lot owned
by Richmond JPJ (JPJ) located within the Plat (“JPJ
Property”). The address of that lot is 33242 South
Shore Drive. The title of the property clearly shows
there is a Plat Covenant which states: No lots shall
be used for commercial business or manufacturing
purposes. This Plat Covenant is present on almost
all lots around Lake Cavanaugh. Regardless, in August
of 2019, Nielsen Brothers Inc. (Nielsen), a logging
company, applied for, and later obtained, a permit
from Skagit County to construct a commercial access
point to South Shore Drive from the JPJ Property.


The commercial use restriction on the Plat
is one of the reasons we moved to Lake Cavanaugh.
We appreciate the relative peace and quiet that
a purely residential community can provide and
this planned use of a residential lot for commercial
purposes would violate the Plat Covenant and would
erode our property rights.	 When I learned of this
prohibited use of a residential lot, I reached out to
DNR to inform them of the commercial use restriction
on the lot and their response was that it was not of
their concern. I then reached out to Skagit County, and
they refused to pull back the permit they issued even
though it was clear to me that the commercial road
violated the zoning as well as the restriction.
Having nowhere else to turn, I filed a Complaint
with the Skagit County Superior Court in October
2019 as a property owner of a lot in the Plat of Lake
Cavanaugh Subdivision No. 3 to prohibit the use of
the JPJ Property for commercial logging purposes
because it violated a covenant that prohibits lots being
used for commercial businesses. Nielsen and JPJ
raised a number of affirmative defenses including
that the Plat Covenant has been abandoned and
counterclaimed to condemn a private way of
necessity.


In April 2020, we moved to have the court,
The Honorable Laura M. Riquelme, rule as a matter
of law that Nielsen’s use of the JPJ Property violated
the Plat Covenant. Riquelme denied the Motion. We
then moved for reconsideration or, in the alternative,
a preliminary injunction. Riquelme denied both
motions. Nielsen started constructing the commercial
road through the JPJ Property shortly thereafter.
In October 2020, we moved to dismiss Nielsen/
JPJs counterclaim to condemn a private way of
necessity for failure to join necessary parties. The
Skagit County Superior Court granted that motion.


A trial was initially scheduled for June 2021,
but was rescheduled to November 2021 due to a
competing criminal trial. After a two-day bench
trial, the court ruled that Nielsen’s logging activity
did not violate the Plat Covenant in a decision dated
January 31, 2022. We appealed to Court of Appeals
Division One. Briefing was completed on October 10,
2022, and the court heard argument of counsel on
January 25, 2023. On February 13, 2023, the Court
of Appeals Division One issued a decision reversing
the previous ruling by Riquelme. The Court of
Appeals determined the Nielsen/JPJ’s use of the
JPJ Property did violate the Plat Covenant. JPJ/
Nielsen petitioned the Washington Supreme Court
for further review. The Washington Supreme Court
declined review in an order dated September 7, 2023.
The Court of Appeals Division One issued a mandate to
Skagit County Superior Court on September 29, 2023.
An agreed order was filed with the Skagit County
Superior Court on January 31, 2024, and Riquelme
signed the agreed order February 8, 2024, which
states, in part:


“It is ORDERED that Defendants, Defendant’s
officers, agents, employees and any other persons acting
directly or indirectly with any of them, are permanently
restrained and enjoined from using the JPJ Property
for commercial business purposes, which specifically
includes, but is not limited to, commercial logging.”


Per the Order, there can be no commercial
activity on the property at 33242 South Shore Drive. It
is important to watch for this to protect our property
rights. If any commercial activity is noticed, please
document, and send a notification to: [rpm32927@
gmail.com](rpm32927@gmail.com).


To be clear, the complaint and all the legal
proceedings were my efforts and not those of the
Lake Cavanaugh Trust. As you can imagine, there is
satisfaction in having preserved our property rights
regardless of the time and expense, but I do not
believe this will be the end of it. For the sake of our
community, please get involved in the Lake Cavanaugh
Trust or the LCIA to help preserve our beautiful and
special piece of Skagit County.


The Lake Cavanaugh Trust was formed
November 17, 1994, with the purpose of “The
Preservation and management of the natural
environment in the Lake Cavanaugh watershed and
surrounding lands”. The Lake Cavanaugh Trust is
actively seeking interested community members to
join and to also serve in various capacities on the
Board. Please contact [Alexander McCullough](mccullough1645@gmail.com), the
current president, if you are interested and/or want
more information: [mccullough1645@gmail.com](mccullough1645@gmail.com)


Special thanks to those of you that supported
my efforts, we could not have prevailed without your
generous support.
