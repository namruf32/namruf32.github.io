As the new President of LCFDA I am looking
forward to 2023 in a very positive and
productive way. I look forward to working with
the Community and the LCIA. Together we can
accomplish anything.

I invite everyone who wants to help
make a difference to contact me personally.
Our first LCFDA meeting is on March 11th. If
you are interested in joining us, our meeting
starts at 10:00 AM. Hope to see you there!
