Friends of the Lake. If you vote in another county and own property at Lake Cavanaugh and you haven't done so already, please consider changing your voter registration to Skagit County.

To register to vote, or to change your voting residence to Skagit County, go to: [https://voter.votewa.gov/portal2023/login.aspx](https://voter.votewa.gov/portal2023/login.aspx)

Your vote has more weight and you have a greater voice in our smaller Skagit County than in a larger county where you may currently be registered. Lake Cavanaugh property owners would be better served if more of us voted in Skagit county. There are more than 500 Lake Cavanaugh addresses around our lake and if 2 adults are registered voters residing at each address that would result in 1000 voters and voices.

To vote in Skagit County, you must be a legal resident with a valid mailing address in Skagit County.
