We would like to extend an invitation to our local crafters to participate. The
only charge is a table fee, with no fee for percentage of sales. What a DEAL!

And we have a special category for Junior Crafters (16 and younger).

If you are interested in participating, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.zeffy.com/en-US/ticketing/aa944996-f502-4b3c-93dc-194e3c31a0f1">apply online</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/_lfs/docs/craft-fair-vendor-application.pdf">download</a> and return an application by August 20.
We want this to be an enjoyable and fun time for everyone.

Have questions?<br>
