The 2024 Lake Cavanaugh Season is upon us. As
I write this it looks and feels like Spring.  It’s time
to open our cottages, dust off the cobwebs and get
out to meet and greet old friends and new. The Fire
Department’s first fund raising event will be our
annual **Open House and Lake Wear Sale on May
26th**.  Our design team has selected several items
that we are sure will appeal to all ages.  We heard
you last year when you said you wanted to see more
items for kids.  Our team made that happen.  Once
again, we have limited numbers of items. The new
Sweatshirts are always popular, so if you want to get
your “Cavanaugh On” show up early to our event.
Open House starts at 9:00AM till Noon.

Looking down the road a bit, I want to remind
you that the **Fun Run will happen in August**. We
are going to try to get the ok to have bikers as
well.  Between now and then, we are looking for a
creative “someone” to design our Fun Run Shirts.
We encourage everyone to submit a picture of your
design by June 15th.  We are even encouraging our
Kids Club to submit entries. PM me your artwork
via our Facebook page. This should be lots of fun.

In closing, I would personally like to invite anyone
and everyone to join our auxiliary team.  There
are no age requirements. We have a lot of fun
and it is very rewarding to raise funds for our
volunteer fire department that isn’t otherwise
given by the county. This past winter we were
able to purchase a trailer for our Fire Boat.
Previously the boat has been housed in a shed
near the boat launch. It is hard to get the boat in
and out of its berth using the existing antiquated
system. After building Station 2, we now have a
dry place to store the Fireboat all year that will
allow easy access via our new and improved boat
launch.  This saves a lot of time getting the boat in
the water if there is an emergency.

Just a reminder that 100% of all Auxiliary Fund-
Raising money is specifically allotted for goods
and equipment for our LC fire department. We
truly appreciate every dollar you contribute
throughout the season to Lake Cavanaugh Fire.
In addition, we are always looking for new fire
recruits. If you would like to join this team, please
speak to one of our volunteers at Open House.
