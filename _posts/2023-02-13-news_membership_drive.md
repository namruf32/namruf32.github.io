**Some of you have asked—What are LCIA membership dues used for? or What does the LCIA do?—Here is an in-depth overview of all that your LCIA membership dues include, and help support.**

[Join online today!](/lcia/dues) or <a href="/_lfs/docs/LCIA-Membership-Form-vers4.pdf" target="blank">By Mail</a>

The Lake Cavanaugh Improvement Association (LCIA) is committed to promoting activities for community
participation and enjoyment for all lake residents, and to solve common problems and achieve common goals as stated in
our bylaws. We are not a political group or organization but simply a community looking to better itself and create events
and activities for all to enjoy. We are also not subsidized by anybody and we receive no tax money.

There is an open invitation to all lake residents to attend and join clubs and groups such as Garden Club, Bunco,
Kids Club, Church in the summer, Happy Hour, Book Club, and special events, such as the Rummage Sale, and new activities
such as the Classic Car Show. We end the season in September with the annual FunFest activities including: craft fair, golf
tournament, games for kids and adults, and Labor Day Dance.

When we host these activities at the Community Center there are operating and building maintenance expenses
that your dues are paying for. In simple terms this includes: cleaning supplies, paper products and so on. In other words,
anything that’s in the cupboards has been donated or paid for by your dues. Volunteers take time out of their busy
schedules to replenish supplies and keep the Community Center building supplied, in good condition and in working order.

There are monthly utilities: propane, electricity, telephone, and garbage pickup; and yearly inspections from the
Health Department for the kitchen permit, for inspection and parts for the safety vent over the propane kitchen stove and
inspection of the septic system. There is also water quality testing for the well and for the lake water. In addition, there
are costs of maintaining the exterior of the building such as paint, roof, furnace, insurance, and the list goes on as it would
with your own home, such as lawn care and window washing. We also sponsor a Dumpster Day each year in July for all
residents to bring their castoff’s. We ask for a donation to help cover the dumpster expenses.

The LCIA also acts on behalf of your community in any government related endeavors or challenges. This would
include communicating when snow plowing is needed, North Shore repair, boat launch updates, chip sealing schedules,
updates on logging, etc. While there are no dollars related to these endeavors, these are just a few of the items that the
LCIA provides for you. We are not subsidized by any other group or entity but strictly maintain communications through
our own LCIA community and volunteers.

We have done significant property improvements in the last four years that required considerable expense, thus
the fundraising events that we have asked the community to contribute to.
- The concrete parking area at the Community Center was built by volunteer labor and was also equipped with sport
court equipment which enables a variety of games—double duty here.
- Another sport court for volleyball and badminton has been installed on the grass over the foot bridge and a permanent
horseshoe pit has been built in that area.
- In 2021 the exterior of the building was repainted for the first time since it was built in 2010.
- Just last year in 2022 the remainder of the parking area was asphalted.

A little bit of background for those who haven’t been on the lake until recently: The Community Center building
was built totally by volunteer help and donated material and funds. It was completed in 2010 and open for use. There are
still volunteers donating their time and materials to keep our Community Center running. There is an article later in this
Special Edition listing the volunteer positions we need help with.

As a dues paying member you receive a reduced rate when renting the Community Center for a private party.
You need not be a member to join in any of the community activities or events, but your
