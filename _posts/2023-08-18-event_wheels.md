## Let’s GET READY TO RUMBLE on down to the Community Center

**Saturday, July 8th from 11 AM to 3 PM**

We had a fantastic turnout for our first gathering last year and we look forward to doing
it again. We're sure that there are some fresh projects out there that need to be seen! You
know who you are! It would be great to have more 2 or 3 wheel rides join as we know a
few live here.

Spread the word to your friends and family with a ride to share. It’s a great
way to spend a day at the lake.

There are no fees to participate and therefore no prizes.
We are also hoping to provide beer tasting and brats.

Just good community summertime fun! See you there!
