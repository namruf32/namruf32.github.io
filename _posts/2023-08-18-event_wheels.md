    Here we are in 2024, let’s rally some wheels at the lake shore.<br>
    Meet up on the 13th of July, we hope you continue to like the reason why.<br>
    Open up your garage bay, fire up that ride, enjoy the day.<br>
    Cars and motorcycles to view, we are working on some food too!<br>
    From electric to steam and everything between.<br>
    Invite your friends with a vehicle to share, come on up, enjoy the lake air.<br>
    What ever happened to the Amphicar? It would certainly be a star.<br>
    11 AM to 3 PM is the time, entrance won’t cost you a dime.<br>
    Come down to the community center and have some fun.<br>
    Talk cars and bikes and relax in the sun.
    </p>
