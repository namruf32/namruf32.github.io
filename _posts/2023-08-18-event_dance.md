      A bit about Nate.......<br>
      Since childhood, I have had respect, appreciation, and a passion for music.
      My love of music ultimately lead to my career in Entertainment as a DJ and MC.
      I specialize in bringing positive energy and professionalism to your event.
      I will take care of you and your guests and ensure they have the best time. I
      have extensive knowledge of music and it expands from every decade and genre
      of music. You can be confident that I will deliver for your big event!

      8 years and we’ve merged our business’s, creating a family business and becoming a
      power team.
