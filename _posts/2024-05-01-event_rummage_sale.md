# Get Hyped for the Rummage Sale July 4-6

Once again, the Lake Cavanaugh Community Center will host the HUGEST SALE on the
lake over the Fourth of July Weekend. We have a core crew that loves this
event, but we need more busy hands, nimble minds, and fun people to make this a
success. Please consider volunteering for a shift or two before or during the
sale. It’s also a great opportunity for teens to get community service hours
and fun for whole families to give back to the lake. Preparing lunch or snacks
for the crew is another appreciated way to contribute. Please contact [Wendy Ostenson](mailto:wendelinann@gmail.com) at 206.228.3339 for more information.

Start your donation piles now! We’ll accept anything in sellable condition,
with the exceptions of tires, printers, TVs, doors, and tube light bulbs. For
larger items such as boats and furniture we ask that you leave contact information if it doesn’t sell.
