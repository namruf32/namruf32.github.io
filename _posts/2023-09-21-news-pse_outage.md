## South Lake Cavanaugh Planned Power Outage Notification

PSE and Potelco electric crews will be performing safety maintenance work to the electric system in our area. Due to the complexity of this work and for the safety of the crews, there will be a planned power outage that will impact the lake. Please see below for the planned outage details.

### Planned Power Outage Details:
**Date:** Wednesday, September 27<br>
**Duration:** Up to seven (7) hours<br>
**To occur between:** 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.<br>
**Where:** South Shore area of Lake Cavanaugh including South Shore Drive, Deer Creek Road, Lucky Lane, and a portion of North Shore Drive, Mount Vernon (please see map below)

Due to the limited space surrounding the work zone, signs and traffic control flaggers will guide vehicles and pedestrians safely through the area.
