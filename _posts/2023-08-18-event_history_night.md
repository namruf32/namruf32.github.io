## Announcing Another Lake Cavanaugh History Night

**July 29, 2023 at the Community Center**

Many things have changed in the Lake Cavanaugh Valley in the past 70 years.
Our special guest will be Dave Granstrom, a native of Finn Settlement, and
witness to early day steam logging and so many changes in the valley.

Also on tap will be a panel of lake residents who bought cabins in the 50s and
60s. Weâ€™ll have tales of how Lake Cavanaugh has changed over the years, of
landslides and washouts and privies out back.

There will be vintage photos from the 40s and later, and books and maps of the area.

Please join us for an evening of discussion and memories of the past.

Donations will be applied toward Sport Court fencing.
